Sphinx Installer CHANGELOG
==========================


v0.0.1     27-Mar-2021
======================
Added Inno Setup based installer that downloads and installs
Python and pip. The script also installs the required pip
packages that support Sphinx.
The Sphinx binaries can be accessed via the `SPHINX_INSTALL_PATH`
environment variable.
